# Sprite Tools for Zelda: ALttP [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sosuke3/ZSpriteTools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sosuke3/ZSpriteTools)

This project contains a library for working with the ZSPR file format used with ALttP randomizer. You will find a sample executable project with examples of how to use the library (and it's useful as a tool for spriters).
